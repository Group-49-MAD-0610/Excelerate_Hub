# Program Details Screen Feature Testing

This guide helps you test the Program Details Screen feature directly without needing authentication.

## Quick Test Methods

### Method 1: Using the Test App (Recommended)

Run the dedicated test app:

```bash
flutter run lib/main_test_feature.dart
```

This will launch a simple app with buttons to test different scenarios:
- Valid program IDs
- Non-existent programs (error handling)
- Empty program IDs
- Different program scenarios

### Method 2: Using Modified Main App

The main app has been temporarily modified to go directly to the Program Details Screen:

```bash
flutter run
```

This will bypass login and go straight to your feature.

### Method 3: Direct Navigation (For Development)

If you want to test from any screen in the app, use:

```dart
AppRoutes.toProgramDetail(context, 'your-program-id-here');
```

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. Loading States
- The screen shows loading indicator while fetching data
- Proper loading messages

### 2. Success States
- Program information displays correctly
- Tabbed interface works (Overview/Curriculum/Instructor)
- Enrollment buttons function
- Share and favorite buttons show "coming soon" messages

### 3. Error States
- Network errors show proper error messages
- Retry button functionality
- Non-existent programs show appropriate errors

### 4. UI Components
- **Program Header**: Title, instructor, rating, price
- **Program Info**: Description, skills, prerequisites
- **Program Curriculum**: Week-by-week breakdown
- **Instructor Info**: Profile and experience

## Feature Capabilities

✅ **Complete MVC Architecture**

- Proper error handling and loading states
- Clean separation of concerns

✅ **Professional UI**
- Material Design components
- Consistent theming
- Responsive layout
- Tab navigation

✅ **Comprehensive Testing**
- 27+ controller tests passing
- Widget tests for basic functionality
- Error handling validation

## Reverting Changes

To restore normal app behavior (with login), revert these files:
- `lib/main.dart` - Change initialRoute back to `AppRoutes.login`
- `lib/core/routes/app_routes.dart` - Change splash route back to HomeScreen

## Current Test Data

The feature currently uses mock/test data since it's a standalone feature. In production, it would connect to your actual API endpoints.
